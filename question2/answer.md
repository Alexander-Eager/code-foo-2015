Question 2
==========

**How many ping pong balls would it take to fill a 747 airplane? Describe each step in your thought process.**

I decided to approach this by taking the volume of a 747-8 freighter, and then assuming the balls are packed optimally into that volume.

This image, taken from Boeing's website, has the specifications for the 747-8F:

![747 volume][]

Based on this, the total usable volume in a 747-8F is **843.7 cubic meters**.

According to [wikipedia][ball size], the diameter of a regulation ball used in international competition is **40 mm = .04 m**. One optimal way to pack these spheres into a cubic meter is using a face-centered cubic pattern like so (image taken from [wikipedia][packing pattern source]):

The optimal packing density by volume as [proven by Carl Friedrich Gauss][packing pattern info], is 

![optimal packing value][]

From there, you just have to do some math to come out with the answer:

So the number of ping pong balls that you can fit in a 747 is _**0**_.
