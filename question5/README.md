Question 5
==========

**Using the results from the previous question, create a web/ios/android application that displays the results and matches [this design] (https://github.com/ign/code-foo-2015/blob/master/design.png). The application should be responsive to common screen/device sizes.**

Reusing most of the same `list_item.js` from the previous question, I just aimed to make the user interface for my application look as much like the design as possible. The article list was not shown in the design image, so I based it of of what I think would be a reasonable fit with the video list. The result stays true to the intended design.
