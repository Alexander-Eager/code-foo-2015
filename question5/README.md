Question 5
==========

**Using the results from the previous question, create a web/ios/android application that displays the results and matches [this design] (https://github.com/ign/code-foo-2015/blob/master/design.png). The application should be responsive to common screen/device sizes.**

Reusing most of the same `list_item.js` from the previous question, I just aimed to make the user interface for my application look as much like the design as possible. The article list was not shown in the design image, so I based it of of what I think would be a reasonable fit with the video list.

There are some issues with the layout of the page that I never had the time to fix. There is a small gap on the lines separating the list items, in between the middle and right portions. There is also an extra line at the bottom of the table that should not be there. I also was not able to round the corners of the white box that the list appears in. The button that switches between articles and videos is also suspect -- it is one button, and the text is not well centered. To be completely honest, I was just too busy this month to make a lot of the little design details just right. I did, however, make sure that all of the functionality of the application worked.
